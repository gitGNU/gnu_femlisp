The Femlisp documentation is written in Texinfo, the GNU documentation
language.  This allows translation in many other formats, e.g. Info, TeX,
or HTML.  A large part of the documentation is the reference manual which
is generated automatically from the docstrings provided in the source code.
Errors found while reading the reference manual should therefore be patched
in the source code.

Issuing the command `make' in the documentation directory generates
documentation in Info, Dvi, Postscript, and HTML format.
