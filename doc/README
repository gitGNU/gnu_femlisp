Femlisp documentation
---------------------

Sorry, there is not much documentation available yet.  The ps-file below is
an article which can be obtained also from the web as

http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/sfb/PP/Preprint2003-11.ps.gz

It was sent to Springer for publication in the EMG proceedings, but has not
yet been accepted.  It describes an almost up-to-date state of Femlisp, and
I plan to rewrite the LaTeX files into a short manual when I have more time
(maybe in November 2003).
