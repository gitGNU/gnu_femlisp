This manual is maintained in Texinfo, and automatically translated into
other forms (e.g. HTML or pdf). If you want to @emph{modify} this
manual, you are advised to and modify the Texinfo version instead of a
translated version.  The manual was created from modifying the Texinfo
files for the SBCL manual written by Rudi Schlatte.
