* Femlisp installation in a Unix environment

** Software needed

 Non-Lisp software:
  - f77, for compiling the LAPACK library for Matlisp
  - Gnuplot, 
  - OpenDX, see http://www.opendx.org

 Common Lisp software:
  - CMUCL, see http://www.cons.org/cmucl/
  - Matlisp, see http://matlisp.sourceforge.net
  - CL-PPCRE, see http://www.weitz.de/cl-ppcre/
  - infix, see ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/lang/lisp/code/syntax/infix/infix.cl
  - [maybe later: CLOCC, see http://clocc.sourceforge.net]

 Lisp-Environment:
  - Emacs
  - (Ilisp?)
  - Hyperspec


** Installation

  0. Make sure that "dx" and "gnuplot" are available and working.
  
  1. Get the shell script <http://www.femlisp.org/install-femlisp>.

  2. Run it, accept the license, and name the installation directory X.
     Installation will need about 120MB disk space.

  3. If the script runs successfully, a startup script for Femlisp can be
     found at X/bin/femlisp.

  4. To set up a simple CL environment, you could use Emacs with
     inferior-lisp-mode.  Better but more difficult to install is ILISP.
     You could also try to use Hemlock with CMUCL.

  5. In any case, you should get yourself some literature on CL. An
     indispensable resource for Common Lisp is the ANSI CL specification
     (Hyperspec), which is available online.


** Possible problems:

*** General

- Femlisp works only with CMUCL at the moment.  This will change in the
  future.

- The installation script works without changes only on Linux for
  x86-architectures.  It should be easy to adapt for Solaris.

*** Matlisp

- I had problems compiling with gcc-2.95.4 on Debian/Woody.  It worked with
  gcc-3.0.  Therefore, one should install gcc, g77 and f2c with version >3.
