* Femlisp installation in a Unix environment

** Software needed

 Non-Lisp software:
  - Gnuplot, 
  - OpenDX, see http://www.opendx.org

 Common Lisp software:
  - CMUCL, see http://www.cons.org/cmucl/
  - CL-PPCRE, see http://www.weitz.de/cl-ppcre/
  - infix, see ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/lang/lisp/code/syntax/infix/infix.cl
  - [maybe later: CLOCC, see http://clocc.sourceforge.net]

 Lisp-Environment:
  - Emacs

** Installation

  0. Make sure that "dx" and "gnuplot" are found in your path and work.
     Otherwise, you will have no graphics.
  
  1. Load the shell script "femlisp-install" by

        wget http://www.femlisp.org/femlisp-install

  2. Run it using

        sh femlisp-install

  3. Accept the license (it allows essentially everything except being
     changed), enter the name of the installation directory (called
     FEMLISP-DIRECTORY in the following which defaults to
     YOUR-HOME-DIRECTORY/FEMLISP).  Installation will need about 120MB disk
     space.

  4. If the script runs successfully, a startup script for Femlisp can be
     found at FEMLISP-DIRECTORY/bin/femlisp which can be executed.

  5. However, it is most reasonable to use Femlisp from within a Lisp
     environment because otherwise you have no command history, etc.  

	 A freely available Lisp environment is Emacs where you can use Ilisp,
     SLIME, or the built-in inferior-lisp-mode together with Femlisp.  For
     inferior-lisp-mode, you should add the following lines to your
     .emacs-file (replacing FEMLISP-DIRECTORY with the correct path):

	 (defun femlisp ()
       "Start femlisp in an inferior-lisp buffer."
       (interactive)
       (run-lisp "FEMLISP-DIRECTORY/bin/femlisp"))

     (setq same-window-buffer-names  ; recommended
        (delete "*inferior-lisp*" same-window-buffer-names))

     Now the Emacs command 'M-x femlisp' should run Femlisp in an inferior
     Lisp buffer.

  6. Start Femlisp and look at the demos by typing in "(demo)" at the
     prompt (do not forget the parentheses!).

  7. If you want to start real work with Femlisp, you should get yourself
     some literature on CL. An indispensable resource for Common Lisp is
     the ANSI CL specification in the form of the Hyperspec, which is
     available online.


** Notes:

- Femlisp is known to work only with CMUCL and SBCL on Linux at the moment.
  It should not be difficult to port it to other CL implementations and
  other computer architectures.

- Without changes the installation script installs CMUCL for Linux on
  x86-architectures.  It should be easy to adapt it to CMUCL on Solaris or
  SBCL on MacOS.
