* Femlisp installation in a Unix environment

** Software needed

 Non-Lisp software:
  - f77, for compiling the LAPACK library for Matlisp
  - gnuplot, dx (Data Explorer) for graphics

 Common Lisp software:
  - CMUCL, see http://www.cons.org/cmucl/
  - Matlisp, see http://matlisp.sourceforge.net
  - CL-PPCRE, see http://www.weitz.de/cl-ppcre/
  - infix, see ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/lang/lisp/code/syntax/infix/infix.cl
  - [maybe later: CLOCC, see http://clocc.sourceforge.net]

 Lisp-Environment:
  - Emacs
  - Ilisp
  - Hyperspec


** Installation

  0. Make sure that f77, dx and gnuplot are available and working.

  1. Create a directory CL-HOME for all Lisp stuff you will be installing.
     Put also the Femlisp directory there.

  2. Install CMUCL.  Load the binaries for your machine (two files) and (my
     suggestion) also the sources for your version.

  3. If you want a true Lisp environment either use XEmacs or install Ilisp
     for GNU Emacs.

  4. An indispensable resource for Common Lisp is the ANSI CL specification
     (Hyperspec), which you should get as well.

[Debian users: All the libraries mentioned before this line are available
as Debian packages (maybe in 'testing').  The following are not yet.]

  5. Install and compile Matlisp.

  6. Install and compile CL-PPCRE.

  7. Get the infix package.

  8. In your Lisp initialization file do something like:

  ;;; *cl-home* should be a string containing the absolute path to CL-HOME
  (setf (logical-pathname-translations "cl")
        `(("**;*.*.*" ,(concatenate 'string *cl-home* "**/*.*.~*~"))))

  (setf (logical-pathname-translations "femlisp")
        '(("**;*.*.*" "cl:femlisp;**;*.*.*")))

  9. Look at the files femlisp/start.lisp and femlisp/femlisp-config.lisp
     if they do what you want.

  10. Compile and load Femlisp using (load "femlisp:start").

  11. Switch to the application package by typing "(in-package
      :application)" into the Lisp listener.  Then you can start the demos
      by typing "(demo)".


** Possible problems:

*** Matlisp

- I had problems compiling with gcc-2.95.4 on Debian/Woody.  It worked with
gcc-3.0.
