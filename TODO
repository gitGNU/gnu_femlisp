Femlisp needs the following more or less urgently:
--------------------------------------------------

* Remove the Femlisp-related bugs from the file BUGS

* Discretization
 - submesh fe and associated quadrature rules
 - sparse interpolation/projection matrices

* Mesh
 - interface to 3D mesh generator 

* Linear algebra
 - switch from sparse-matrix to CCS (?)
 - more Krylov-type methods

* Problem solving
 - more time-stepping schemes

* Parallelization
 - far from complete on SMP machines (now: only assembly, no large speedup)
 - not yet started on clusters
