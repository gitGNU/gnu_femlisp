Femlisp needs the following more or less urgently:
--------------------------------------------------


Near future, relatively easy extensions
---------------------------------------

* Removal of known bugs, see the file BUGS.

* Local multigrid for systems.  Up to now, this works only for scalar
  equations and with AMG as coarse-mesh solver.

* Improved linear algebra, see the FAQ.

* Some nonlinear solvers.

* Some time-stepping schemes.

* Plotting for prisms.  This is very easy by mapping prisms to cubes, but
  will probably only be done when someone needs it.

* Port to SBCL.  This should be easy and would make Femlisp work on
  Macintosh computers.

* Port to CLISP.  This is interesting mainly because of testing ANSI
  conformance.

* Switch to asdf and asdf-install for installation.


Intermediate future
-------------------

* Improved polynomial manipulation by using Maxima.  Something like the
  following should be accessible from Lisp:

load ("specfun");
FPPREC:30;
bfloat(allroots (legendre_p(10,x)));

... calculation of quadrature rules, shape functions, ...

* Maybe: interface to a linear sparse solver like SuperLU.


Distant future
--------------

* Parallelization
