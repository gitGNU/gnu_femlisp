Femlisp needs the following more or less urgently:
--------------------------------------------------

* Remove the Femlisp-related bugs from the file BUGS

* Discretization

 - submesh fe and associated quadrature rules
 - sparse interpolation/projection matrices
 - more FE methods, e.g. Discontinuous Galerkin
 - Better implementation of Lagrange ansatz-spaces on product cells
 - Higher precision of Lagrange shape function values and derivatives
   at interpolation points
 - OS thread parallelization of one-time calculation of quadrature
   schemes, shape and gradient, and interpolation
   
* Linear algebra

 - sparse LR for the sparse-matrix format
 - switch from sparse-matrix to CCS (?)
 - more Krylov-type methods

* Problem solving

 - more time-stepping schemes

* Parallelization

 - automatic use of parallel resources
 - seamless cooperation with an MPI slave cluster

Smaller improvements
--------------------

* Discretization

 - implement zero-variate polynomials (i.e. scalars)
 - better polynomial implementation

* Parallelization

- Concurrent binary trees
