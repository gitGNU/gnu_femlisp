Femlisp needs the following more or less urgently:
--------------------------------------------------


Near future, relatively easy extensions
---------------------------------------

* Removal of known bugs, see the file BUGS.

* Local multigrid for systems.  Up to now, this works only for scalar
  equations and with AMG as coarse-mesh solver.

* Improved linear algebra, see the FAQ.

* Some nonlinear solvers.

* Some time-stepping schemes.

* Plotting for prisms.  This is very easy by mapping prisms to cubes, but
  will probably only be done when someone needs it.

Distant future
--------------

* Parallelization
