Femlisp needs the following more or less urgently:
--------------------------------------------------


Near future, relatively easy extensions
---------------------------------------

* Removal of known bugs, see the file BUGS.

* Local multigrid for systems.  Up to now, this works only for scalar
  equations and with AMG as coarse-mesh solver.

* Improved linear algebra, see the FAQ.

* Some nonlinear solvers.

* Some time-stepping schemes.

* Plotting for prisms.  This is very easy by mapping prisms to cubes, but
  will probably only be done when someone needs it.


Intermediate future
-------------------

* Improved polynomial manipulation by using Maxima.  Something like the
  following should be accessible from Lisp:

load ("specfun");
FPPREC:30;
bfloat(allroots (legendre_p(10,x)));

... calculation of quadrature rules, shape functions, ...

* Port to SBCL (port Matlisp first).  This would make Femlisp work on
  Macintosh computers.

* Port to CLISP (port Matlisp first).  This is interesting mainly because
  of testing ANSI conformance.

* Good integration of nonlinear solvers and time-stepping schemes.

* Maybe: interface to a sparse solver like SuperLU.


Distant future
--------------

* Parallelization
