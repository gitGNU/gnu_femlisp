Femlisp needs the following more or less urgently:
--------------------------------------------------

* Remove the Femlisp-related bugs from the file BUGS

* Discretization
 - all problems/discretizations as special cases of ellsys
 - tensor-product fe and associated quadrature rules
 - sparse interpolation/projection matrices

* Mesh
 - interface to 3D mesh generator 
 - anisotropic refinement rules

* Linear algebra
 - switch from sparse-matrix to CCS (?)
 - more Krylov-type methods

* Problem solving
 - more time-stepping schemes
 - better solution of eigenvalue problems

* Parallelization
 - far from complete on SMP machines (only assembly)
 - not yet started on clusters
