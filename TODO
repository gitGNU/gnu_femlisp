Femlisp needs the following more or less urgently:
--------------------------------------------------

* Removal of known bugs, see the file BUGS.

* Local multigrid for systems.  Up to now, this works only for scalar
  equations and with AMG as coarse-mesh solver.

* Plotting for prisms.  This should be easy by mapping prisms to cubes, but
  will probably only be done when someone needs it.

* Improved linear algebra for sparse matrices, see the FAQ.

* Nonlinear solvers.

* Time-stepping schemes.

* Parallelization
