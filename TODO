Femlisp needs the following more or less urgently:
--------------------------------------------------

* Removal of known bugs, see the file BUGS.

* Discretization:
 - keep only vector finite elements
 - sparse interpolation/projection matrices

* Mesh refinement:
 - anisotropic refinement rules

* Improved linear algebra for sparse matrices, see the FAQ.
 - switch to CCS for speed?

* More time-stepping schemes.

* Improved solution of eigenvalue problems.

* Parallelization.
