Femlisp needs the following more or less urgently:
--------------------------------------------------

* Removal of known bugs, see the file BUGS

* Discretization
 - scalar fe as special case of vector fe
 - tensor-product fe and associated quadrature rules
 - sparse interpolation/projection matrices

* Mesh
 - interface to 3D mesh generator 
 - anisotropic refinement rules

* Linear algebra
 - switch from sparse-matrix to CCS (?)
 - more Krylov-type methods

* Problem solving
 - more time-stepping schemes
 - better solution of eigenvalue problems

* Parallelization
 - does not work well on SMP machines at the moment (no good speedup)
 - not yet started on clusters
