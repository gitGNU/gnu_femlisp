Femlisp needs the following more or less urgently:
--------------------------------------------------

Near future, relatively easy extensions:

* Removal of all bugs, see the file BUGS.

* Dirichlet boundary values should be allowed to be defined differently for
  multiple right-hand sides.  OTOH, changing the type of BC for different
  rhs is not easy, see the FAQ.

* Local multigrid for systems.  Up to now, this works only for scalar
  equations and with AMG as coarse-mesh solver.

* Improved linear algebra, see the FAQ.

* Integration of nonlinear solvers.

* Integration of time-stepping schemes.

* Plotting for prisms.  This is very easy by mapping prisms to cubes, but
  will probably only be done when someone needs it.


Far future:

* Parallelization
