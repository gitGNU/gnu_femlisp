Femlisp needs the following more or less urgently:
--------------------------------------------------

* Remove the Femlisp-related bugs from the file BUGS

* Discretization
 - submesh fe and associated quadrature rules
 - sparse interpolation/projection matrices
 - more FE methods, e.g. Discontinuous Galerkin

* Linear algebra
 - sparse LR for sparse-matrix
 - switch from sparse-matrix to CCS (?)
 - more Krylov-type methods

* Problem solving
 - more time-stepping schemes

* Parallelization
 - automatic use of parallel resources
 - seamless cooperation with an MPI slave cluster

Smaller improvements
--------------------

* Discretization
 - implement zero-variate polynomials (i.e. scalars)
