* About DDO (Dynamic Distributed Objects)

** Project goal

This project provides an object-oriented layer for painlessly managing
distributed objects.

* Testing DDO

** Compiling the workers

# in some directory do
sbcl --eval "(asdf:load-system :mpi-worker)"

# the result should be a binary "mpi-worker" in that directory

** Testing interactively

# in that directory do (with xx denoting the number of workers)
mpirun -np xx mpi-worker

# You can then run another CL/ddo-instance (best using Emacs/SLIME)
# and execute the commands in "ddo/test.lisp".

** Testing via running a script

mpirun -np 2 mpi-worker --eval "(progn (fl.debug:dbg-on :ddo-test) (loop for level upto 5 do (ddo-test::test level 1000)))"
