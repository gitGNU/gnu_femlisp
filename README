Femlisp - a Common Lisp FEM framework

Femlisp is a FEM (finite element method) framework for the solution of
partial differential equations.  It is written entirely in Common Lisp and
runs in a Linux environment using the Common Lisp implementation CMUCL, see
http://www.cons.org/cmucl.  It also uses the following CL extensions:

- Matlisp: a CL interface to LAPACK (<http://matlisp.sourceforge.net>)
- CL-PPCRE: regular expressions for CL (<http://www.weitz.de/cl-ppcre>)
- infix: C-style infix syntax for CL
  (<ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/user/ai/lang/lisp/code/syntax/infix/infix.cl>)

Additionally, Femlisp plots using the programs:

- OpenDX (IBM's Data Explorer)
- Gnuplot

Femlisp is licensed under a FreeBSD style license, see the file 'LICENSE'
in the Femlisp main directory.

Installation instructions can be found in the file 'INSTALL'.

Femlisp's homepage is <http://www.femlisp.org>.

Some documentation can be found in the subdirectory 'doc'.  Please remember
also documentation and apropos function of your CL environment.

Have much fun using Femlisp!
