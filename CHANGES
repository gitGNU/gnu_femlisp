* From Femlisp-0.8.4 to Femlisp-0.8.5:

The mesh module was improved.  Especially, cells are now CLOS classes
instead of structures (as it was already written down in my article on
Femlisp).  The classes are automatically generated at runtime.

A new package called FEMLISP.MATLISP was introduced which acts at the
moment as an interface to MATLISP.  The next move will be to plug in my
Matlisp replacement.  (This replacement is ready up to some polishing.)

The regression test suite was improved.  Especially, all demos are now
tested as well.

Some errors were removed.

* From Femlisp-0.8.3 to Femlisp-0.8.4:

The iteration module was improved.  Iterative solvers and problem solution
stragtegies are now subclasses of iterations.  This allows for the easy
integration of nonlinear solvers and time stepping schemes.

The interface for solving has changed to the form (SOLVE SOLVER
BLACKBOARD).  That is, the problem to be solved is now defined on a
blackboard and the solution is written to this blackboard.  This is true
for both linear solvers and problem solution strategies.

Several smaller changes.

* From Femlisp-0.8.2 to Femlisp-0.8.3:

Removed a bug in the refinement of product cells which contain simplices of
dimension >=3.

Adaption to the new Matlisp.  MATRIX-REF is a macro dispatching to
MATRIX-REF-1D and MATRIX-REF-2D.  We also unexport MATLISP:REAL after
loading Matlisp, because it interferes with COMMON-LISP:REAL.
