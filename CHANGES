* From Femlisp-0.8.3 to Femlisp-0.8.4:

The iteration module was improved.  Iterative solvers and problem solution
stragtegies are now subclasses of iterations.  This allows for the easy
integration of nonlinear solvers and time stepping schemes.

The interface for solving has changed to the form (SOLVE SOLVER
BLACKBOARD).  That is, the problem to be solved is now defined on a
blackboard and the solution is written to this blackboard.  This is true
for both linear solvers and problem solution strategies.

Several smaller changes.

* From Femlisp-0.8.2 to Femlisp-0.8.3:

Removed bug in refinement of product cells which contained simplices of
dimension >=3.

Adaption to the new Matlisp. MATRIX-REF is a macro dispatching to
MATRIX-REF-1D and MATRIX-REF-2D.  We also unexport MATLISP:REAL after
loading Matlisp, because it interferes with COMMON-LISP:REAL.
