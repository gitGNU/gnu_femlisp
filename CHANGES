* From Femlisp-0.8.2 to Femlisp-0.8.3:

Removed bug in refinement of product cells which contained simplices of
dimension >=3.

Adaption to the new Matlisp. MATRIX-REF is a macro dispatching to
MATRIX-REF-1D and MATRIX-REF-2D.  We also unexport MATLISP:REAL after
loading Matlisp, because it interferes with COMMON-LISP:REAL.
