This is a list of known bugs:
-----------------------------

* Complex arrays do not yet work with Lispworks and Allegro (which implies
  that eigenvalue problems are not handled correctly).

* inside-cell? does not test correctly for lower-dimensional cells.

* Parallel solving still does not work reliably.

* Geometric multigrid with local refinement is not working yet.  Algebraic
  multigrid of Ruge-Stueben type works for equations also in the case of
  local refinement.

* There are some bugs in Data explorer (or in the interface):

  - script mode has problems depending on the "-processors 1" option,
    sometimes that option has to be provided, sometimes not

  - Windows are not closed when terminating the program, but have to be
    killed separately.

  - One cannot assign other colors to plots of 1d fe functions.  

  - On some systems black lines can appear on plots of some regular meshes.

  - The size of glyphs cannot be reasonably influenced for DIM=3.
