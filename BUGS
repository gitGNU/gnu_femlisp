This is a list of known bugs:
-----------------------------

* Unfortunately, the communication with Data Explorer on Mac OS X is not
  working correctly.

* Dirichlet boundary values should be allowed to be defined differently for
  multiple right-hand sides.  OTOH, changing the type of BC for different
  rhs is not easy, see the FAQ.
