This is a list of known bugs:
-----------------------------

* Geometric multigrid with local refinement is not working yet.  However,
  algebraic multigrid of Ruge-Stueben type works for equations also in the
  case of local refinement.

* Dirichlet boundary values should be allowed to be defined differently for
  multiple right-hand sides.  OTOH, changing the type of BC for different
  rhs is not easy, see the FAQ.
