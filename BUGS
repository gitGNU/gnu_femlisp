This is a list of known bugs:
-----------------------------

* Geometric multigrid with local refinement is not working yet.  Algebraic
  multigrid of Ruge-Stueben type works for equations also in the case of
  local refinement.

* On Windows/Cygwin, the communication with OpenDX does not yet work.  A
  remedy is to use OpenDX as a separate application on the output file
  @path{femlisp/images/output.dx}.  This bug may well lie outside of
  Femlisp, since also "dx -script" in an xterm window does not work.

* Parallelization on multithreaded architectures is not yet complete.

* Loading the SuperLU/UMFPACK interface was observed to fail on
  Suse/AMD64.  (Remedy: work without SuperLU/UMFPACK.)
