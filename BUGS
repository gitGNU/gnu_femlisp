This is a list of known bugs:
-----------------------------

* There is still a bug for refining n-dimensional cubes for n>=5.  This has
  the effect that 5-dimensional hypercubes cannot even be generated,
  because a reference refinement is then generated.  On the other hand,
  n-dimensional simplices work.
