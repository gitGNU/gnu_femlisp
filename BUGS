This is a list of known bugs:
-----------------------------

* inside-cell? does not test correctly for lower-dimensional cells

* Multithreaded SBCL does not show FL.APPLICATION when starting a core.

* Parallel solving still does not work reliably.

* Geometric multigrid with local refinement is not working yet.  Algebraic
  multigrid of Ruge-Stueben type works for equations also in the case of
  local refinement.

* There are some bugs in the Data explorer which have not yet been worked
  around.  E.g, you cannot assign other colors to plots of 1d fe
  functions.  And on some systems black lines can appear on plots of
  some regular meshes.

* On Windows/Cygwin, the communication with OpenDX does not yet work.  A
  remedy is to use OpenDX as a separate application on the output file
  @path{femlisp/images/output.dx}.  This bug may well lie outside of
  Femlisp, since also "dx -script" in an xterm window does not work.
