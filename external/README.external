For convenience, this directory contains some software by other parties and
which some parts of Femlisp call.  This is the following:

- Dan Barlow's ASDF system definition utility.  This is bundled with SBCL
  but not yet with CMUCL.  This software is part of the CCLAN project
  hosted at www.sourceforge.net.

- Mark Kantrowitz' INFIX package from the CMU AI repository.

- Edi Weitz' CL-PPCRE, if you install it by executing "make cl-ppcre" from
  the Femlisp main directory.
