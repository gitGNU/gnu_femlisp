This directory contains some software by other parties which can be
used together with Femlisp.  Note that this is only useful, if those
libraries cannot be installed outside of Femlisp for general use.

- Jonathan Richard Shewchuk's TRIANGLE for triangulating 2D domains.
  This library can be fetched from the web by issuing the command
  "make triangle" from within the Femlisp main directory.  On Debian
  Linux and variants, do "apt install triangle-bin" instead.

- Hang Si's Tetgen for generating tetrahedral meshes.  This library
  can be fetched from the web by issuing the command "make tetgen"
  from within the Femlisp main directory.  On Debian Linux and
  variants, do "apt install tetgen" instead.

- Temporarily, I have put my adaption "cl-cpu-affinity" of Nikodemus
  Siivola's "sb-cpu-affinity" library also in this directory.  It will
  be removed, as soon as it becomes a standard Quicklisp library.

- For setting CPU affinities, Femlisp needs the "lscpu" command for
  determining the machine architecture it is currently running on.
  Since I encountered problems calling this command at runtime when
  memory was tight, Femlisp looks in this directory ("external"), if
  it can find a file "lscpu-e-output" which should contain the output of
  "lscpu -e".
