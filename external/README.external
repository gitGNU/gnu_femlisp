This directory contains some software by other parties which can be used
together with Femlisp.

- Dan Barlow's ASDF system definition utility.  This is bundled with SBCL
  but not yet with CMUCL.  This software is part of the CCLAN project
  hosted at www.sourceforge.net.

- Mark Kantrowitz' INFIX package from the CMU AI repository.  Because the
  license is not free in its strict sense, it is not included
  automatically, but can be fetched from the web by issuing the command
  "make infix" from within the Femlisp main directory.

- Jonathan Richard Shewchuk's TRIANGLE for triangulating 2D domains.  This
  can be fetched from the web by issuing the command "make triangle" from
  within the Femlisp main directory.
