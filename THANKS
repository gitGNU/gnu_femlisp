Femlisp owes thanks mainly to the following people, groups, and
institutions (in reverse chronological order):

- Franz Inc. for giving me access to an evaluation copy of Allegro CL,

- the FSF for hosting Femlisp at savannah.nongnu.org,

- Gabriel Wittum and the University of Heidelberg for allowing me to
  publish Femlisp under the FreeBSD license,

- Gabriel Wittum for supporting me a lot,

- the Lisp gurus and non-gurus of the comp.lang.lisp newsgroup for sharing
  their knowledge with me in the years from 2000 onwards,

- Kent Pitman et al for giving us the CL Hyperspec,

- the CMUCL implementors for writing this nice Lisp implementation, and
  them and the CMUCL users for the immediate help on the mailing lists,

- the Matlisp crew for providing this nice LAPACK interface,

- IBM for making OpenDX free software,

- the people from the Guile mailing list which helped me in learning Scheme
  which finally led me to Common Lisp,

- Richard Stallman and all other Emacs contributors for writing Emacs,

- Christian Wieners for pointing me to Emacs,

- the UG group in which I learned a lot about PDE software.
