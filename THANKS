Femlisp owes thanks mainly to the following people, groups, and
institutions (in something like reverse chronological order):

- The FSF for hosting Femlisp at savannah.nongnu.org.

- Professor Gabriel Wittum and the University of Heidelberg for allowing me
  to publish Femlisp under the FreeBSD license.

- Gabriel Wittum for supporting me especially during the last years when I
  used a considerable part of my time for writing Femlisp.

- The Lisp gurus and non-gurus of the comp.lang.lisp newsgroup for sharing
  their knowledge with me in the years from 2000 onwards.

- Kent Pitman et al for giving us the CL Hyperspec.

- The CMUCL implementors for writing this nice Lisp implementation, and
  them and the CMUCL users for the immediate help on the mailing lists.

- The Matlisp crew for providing this nice LAPACK interface.

- IBM for making OpenDX free software.

- The people from the Guile mailing list which helped me in learning Scheme
  which finally led me to Common Lisp.

- Richard Stallman and all other Emacs contributors for writing Emacs.

- Christian Wieners for showing me Emacs for the first time.

- The UG group in which I learned a lot about PDE software.
